# House Price Prediction Model**
# Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project covers the entire data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

# Project Structure
**house_price_prediction.ipynb:** The main Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire process of building a house price prediction model. This includes:
**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection and removal, and encoding categorical features.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing various plots such as box plots, histograms, line plots, and heatmaps to uncover insights and identify patterns.
**Model Development:** Scaling features and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Various models are tested to find the best one.
**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², and checking for overfitting or underfitting.

# Visualizations
The project includes detailed visualizations to help understand the data better and to showcase the model's performance.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any improvements or bug fixes.
